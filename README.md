# Problem Solving Process

1. Understand the problem
1. Devise a plan
1. Carry out the plan
1. Look back

### 1. Understand the problem

#### inputs: .json file containing HTML

#### outputs: rendered HTML on page

### edge cases: very deeply nested JSON and adding html with classes as well as CSS framework syntax

### 2. Devise a plan

1. learn some FileAPI's syntax
1. experiment with accessing information inside of files using learned syntax
1. get functionality out of easiest example
1. handle edge cases as complexity increases with each example

### 3. Carry Out the plan


### 4. Look back
